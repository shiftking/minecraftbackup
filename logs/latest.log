[00:21:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> And another row of crops
[00:21:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> Im not happy with my farm layout right now

[00:21:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I don't know how to fix though
[00:21:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Not even enchanted armor.

[00:23:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> rip
[00:23:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> this guy has a zombo spawner though
[00:23:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> was using that earlier
[00:23:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> So your house isnt even in your castle.
[00:23:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <DecidedFate333> lol fyi no more than 20 minutes at the zombie grinder, can crash the server after half an hour
[00:23:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> Im going to expand this
[00:23:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <DecidedFate333> like kill the stack every 20-30
[00:24:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> I like this tower.
[00:24:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> Im planning on kicking derrick off
[00:24:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> this island
[00:24:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> and expanding out
[00:24:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> What island?
[00:24:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> this ridge up here
[00:24:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Hes way over there.
[00:25:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> Building out that way
[00:25:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> Yeah
[00:25:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I want to make like a grand castle area
[00:25:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> and then Dylans little village will be my peasentville
[00:25:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Sounds pimp.
[00:25:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> Don
[00:25:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Derricks house is ugly anyways.
[00:25:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> know how I'm going to do it though
[00:25:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> Like that little castle area over there is just going to be my library tower
[00:25:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> and enchanting area
[00:25:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> and potion area etc
[00:26:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Leave room and we can design a big redstone castle gate.
[00:26:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> mhmm
[00:26:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> It's either I'm going to do that
[00:26:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> or just make another smaller trower in the middle of the forest
[00:26:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> and connect the three
[00:26:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> Kinda like over there
[00:26:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Make walls to it.
[00:27:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> yea
[00:27:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <DecidedFate333> lol literally building a tower in the middle of a roofed forest XD
[00:27:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> make the giant castle a big dick.
[00:27:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Two balls and a bell end.
[00:27:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> BALLS AND SHAFT BB
[00:27:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Stole my bed!
[00:27:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Nigga.
[00:27:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I did
[00:27:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> No shame
[00:28:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> except I added a bed
[00:28:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> because I am fat
[00:28:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I need the room
[00:28:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> I might make a room in the upstairs of my house and have a larger bedroom.
[00:28:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> But I kind of like the smaller rooms I got going now.
[00:28:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> mhmm
[00:28:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Everythings functional.
[00:28:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I don't know, I like big open spaces, and kinda spaced out
[00:28:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Need a amssive crowd sourced map room though.
[00:28:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I don't like being crammed
[00:28:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I like that idea
[00:29:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I read the sign
[00:29:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> If you could get it to cover the whole village that would be dope
[00:29:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> I got 4 of my area in my room but I wanna put that whole wall.
[00:29:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Oh it will go for tons of space.
[00:29:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> I like open space if we share living areas.
[00:30:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> If its just me I like buildings everywhere.
[00:30:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> That's my current problem
[00:30:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> If Dylan and Derrick didnt build up here
[00:30:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I would already be building my huge castle idea
[00:30:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> Just cuck derrick.
[00:30:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <HoboInArmy> He can live in his turd shack.
[00:30:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> lol
[00:32:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <DecidedFate333> you guys use resource packs?
[00:32:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I used to
[00:32:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I find being ablle to build something in vanilla better
[00:33:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> well and actually make it look decent
[00:33:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <DecidedFate333> I definitely like the look my resource pack gives to what I got, but vanilla doesn't look as good :(
[00:33:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> I like the old school charm it gives
[00:33:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <DecidedFate333> I will post a simple example in dischord
[00:33:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Joedoodle> all pixel
